Intrinsic-Ratio-for-LESS-and-SASS
=================================

A reusable class to be used in a dynamic stylesheet language (LESS or SASS). 

Code is heavily commented to help you understand.

Even though assets>less>styles.less and assets>less>styles.scss are two files, they use the exact same code. 


Please note: Code in "demo.css" is purely for the demo file only and does not contain relevant code.
